   - Endpoint: GET /api/posts/:id
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Example Title",
       "content": "Lorem ipsum...",
       "author": "John Doe",
       "date": "2023-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
     }
     ```

4. **Update a post by ID**
   - Endpoint: PUT /api/posts/:id
   - Request Body:
     ```json
     {
       "title": "Updated Title",
       "content": "Updated content...",
       "author": "John Doe"
     }
     ```
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "id": 1,
       "title": "Updated Title",
       "content": "Updated content...",
       "author": "John Doe",
       "date": "2023-10-19T12:00:00.000Z"
     }
     ```

5. **Delete a post by ID**
   - Endpoint: DELETE /api/posts/:id
   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "message": "Post deleted successfully"
     }
     ```

**Frontend Implementation:**

1. **List all posts:**
   - Fetch all posts using GET /api/posts and display them in a list.

2. **Create a new post:**
   - Create a form to input title, content, and author.
   - On form submission, send a POST request to /api/posts.

3. **View a specific post:**
   - Clicking on a post in the list fetches the details using GET /api/posts/:id and displays them.

4. **Update a post:**
   - Allow the user to edit a post and submit changes using PUT /api/posts/:id.

5. **Delete a post:**
   - Provide a button to delete a post, and on click, send a DELETE request to /api/posts/:id.

**Additional Considerations:**
- Handle loading and error states for API requests.
- Implement client-side routing for navigation between different views (list, create, edit).
- Implement form validation on the frontend side.
- Consider adding authentication if user accounts are involved.
- Add loading spinners or indicators during API requests.
- Ensure error messages are displayed to users when API requests fail.

This sketch provides a high-level overview of the API endpoints and their expected responses. The frontend developer can use this information to structure their components, implement data fetching, and handle user interactions.
